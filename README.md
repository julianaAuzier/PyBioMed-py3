# PyBioMed-py3
This is the converted PyBioMed module (py2 to py3). If you can't use this project, just install 2to3 and apply it to module files folder. (It works to me).

For another (first) problem, open your env folder and then -> Lib\site-packages\PyBioMed\PyGetMol -> GetProtein.py, search for "file(" and change it to "open(".

I hope this works for you!
